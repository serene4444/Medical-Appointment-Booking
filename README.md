# 🏥 Medical Appointment Booking Website

Welcome to the **Medical Appointment Booking Web App**, a responsive front-end project designed to simplify appointment scheduling and enhance digital healthcare access. This application was built as a portfolio project using the guidance and tools from [Coursera's Front-End Development Capstone Project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/front-end-development-capstone-project).

---

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates a **HealthCert-inspired platform**, allowing users to:

- 📅 **Book medical appointments**
- 🧑‍⚕️ **View provider profiles**
- 🔐 **Access health records** (mock display)
- 🧭 **Track healthcare progress** via a user dashboard

This is a **fully responsive site** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and can be extended with backend integration (e.g. Firebase, FastAPI) for production use.

Please note that this is a mock presentation highlighting the concepts behind the project. This project was created several months ago when I began my journey into full-stack development. It originated as part of a group project based on my original idea. I served as the project manager, and now, months later, I still plan to continue developing my website beyond its initial stage.
