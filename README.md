# 🏥 Medical Appointment Booking Website

Welcome to the **Medical Appointment Booking Web App**, a responsive front-end project designed to simplify appointment scheduling and enhance digital healthcare access. This application was built as a portfolio project using the guidance and tools from [Coursera's Front-End Development Capstone Project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/front-end-development-capstone-project).

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates a **HealthCert-inspired platform**, allowing users to:

- 📅 **Book medical appointments**
- 🧑‍⚕️ **View provider profiles**
