## Problem Statement  

Healthcare systems struggle with inefficient appointment scheduling, fragmented patient communications, and limited accessibility to booking services. HealthCert solves these challenges by providing a centralized, intuitive platform for medical appointment management and patient-provider interaction.

- In future iterations, we plan to enable a seamless transfer of healthcare data by providing secure, shareable access to a wide network of specialists. This will give users the advantage of visiting new doctors or specialists without the burden of repeatedly filling out forms or restating their current medical history.
