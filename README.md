HealthCert is a comprehensive medical appointment booking and patient management system designed to streamline healthcare accessibility and enhance patient care coordination. Our platform addresses critical challenges in appointment scheduling, patient data management, and healthcare provider communication through a secure, user-friendly web application.

## Problem Statement  

Healthcare systems struggle with inefficient appointment scheduling, fragmented patient communications, and limited accessibility to booking services. HealthCert solves these challenges by providing a centralized, intuitive platform for medical appointment management and patient-provider interaction.

- In future iterations, we plan to enable a seamless transfer of healthcare data by providing secure, shareable access to a wide network of specialists. This will give users the advantage of visiting new doctors or specialists without the burden of repeatedly filling out forms or restating their current medical history.
